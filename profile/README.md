**AcmeNet** is an ambitious initiative by the *Acme Corporation* to create a decentralized and federated network of platforms that perform digital economic transactions on a common protocol. 

AcmeNet does not have a central controlling entity. All platforms on AcmeNet transact peer-to-peer. No third party has visibility into _any_ transaction unless explicitly given access by a platform. However, to provide the element of trust, AcmeNet has a network facilitator organization called Acme Corp, a not-for-profit organization that provides a framework for,

1. Transaction Interoperability
2. Enabling Fair trade
3. Establishing Trust 
4. Managing Reputation
5. Policy Transmission
6. Grievance Redressal
7. Dispute Resolution
8. Open Data

Acmenet has a two-layered architecture. The first layer (Layer 0), also known as the _base layer_ consists of interfaces that communicate only using beckn protocol. The second layer consists of specifications, recommendations, web services, and policies that are specific to AcmeNet Subscribers only. 

This organization has been created as a reference to anyone who wants to set up an open network. Adopters are encouraged to contribute to this account as much as possible so as to cover a wide range of use cases and locations.
